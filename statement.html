<center>  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Melody Shepard and I am currently a freshman at San Jose State University. I intend to major in Digital Media Art, although I have more experience in traditional mediums. <br> I intend to major in Digital Media Art, although I have more experience in traditional mediums.  <br> As a young child, I had a talent for drawing and quickly learned how to use other mediums such as color pencil, watercolor and acrylic painting.  <br>Art was something that has always came naturally to me and I was able to teach myself how to layer colors to create vibrant drawings.  <br>I translated this skill into my digital drawings, which can be seen in my "Take a Dive" website.
     <br> <br>
     Two of my projects are films that I shot and edited, "Origin" and "City of Lights."  <br> For the stories I wanted to tell, video was the best suitiable medium. <br> Origin is something very personal and I hold it very close to me; to hear my mother's voice as she recalls memories from decades and decades ago. <br> I am always in search for the perfect medium to tell my stories and to frame my narrative with an excellent composition. <br> I explored topics like gambling in City of Lights because I realized how many children of the younger generation are spending hundreds of dollars on digital currencies or surprise toys. <br> The nonstop flashing casino lights and signs could best be interpreted into the medium of video. <br> For Take a Dive, I wanted to spread awareness that we are disturbing millions of wildlife by dumping trash in the ocean, specifically the Mariana Trench, which is already loaded with plastic waste. <br> The ocean and the wonders of what lurks below has always compelled me. <br> I find myself caught between wanting to know more about the deep sea, but also wanting to respect the life that lives there, as we have already done too much damage. <br> In my future projects, I will continue to explore the topics of my cultural heritage and the ocean.
